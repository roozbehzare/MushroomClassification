# mushroom classification


This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify mushrooms as either poisonous or edible using a species dataset. The project explores various data processing techniques, models, and evaluation metrics to ensure an accurate and efficient classification system.


# Project Highlights


Objective: To distinguish between poisonous and edible mushrooms based on their features.
Techniques Used: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms.
Models Explored: Various machine learning models, including ensemble methods.
Evaluation: Comparison of performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score


# Dataset


The dataset contains mushroom species described by several categorical and ordinal features. Each sample is labeled as "poisonous" or "edible." The dataset is used to train and evaluate the model.


# Notable Steps in the Pipeline


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
